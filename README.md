# Letterbox Solver

## Premise
The new york times, famed publishers of the crossword and wordle also have host other word games
such as Letter Box (https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed). I personally enjoy this one most of all,
but lack the word game prowess to solve every puzzle. This is why I have created this project, with aims of out sourcing
the tedium of puzzle solving to the computer, so us humans can get on with our business

## Instructions for use 
- Imputing letters into the box (first required event)
    - First run the main method in src\gui\Display.java. When the gui pops up keyboard focus will automatically be on the first box, and entering a letter will advance the carat to the next box.
- Adding / creating, then displaying a solution (second required event)
    - Once all letters have been entered (note: I'd recommend sticking with solving actual letterboxed puzzles, It wont let you enter a invalid set of letters, but from what I've found random letters only produce a solution about half the time) press the button labeled "go!". After it's found the solution will be displayed automatically.
- The visual component of the program would be the font if I had to choose. It can be found by running the gui.
- Once a solution has been found, it can be saved to a text file (along with the letter box associated with it) by clicking the button labeled save.


## User stories
* sure a box is great, but i prefer other shapes (triangle, hexagon, etc.). When will you let me solve those?
* i ain't about to let no son of sam-ual johnson tell me what is and isn't a word, which is why i've curated and edited my own english dictionary. When will you let me solve Letter Box for it?
