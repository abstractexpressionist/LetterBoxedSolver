# Letterbox Solver

## Premise

### The new york times, famed publishers of the crossword and wordle also have host other word games
### such as Letter Box (https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed). I personally enjoy this one most of all,
### but lack the word game prowess to solve every puzzle. This is why I have created this project, with aims of out sourcing
### the tedium of puzzle solving to the computer, so us humans can get on with our business


## User stories
* sure a box is great, but i prefer other shapes (triangle, hexagon, etc.). When will you let me solve those?
* i ain't about to let no son of sam-ual johnson tell me what is and isn't a word, which is why i've curated and edited my own english dictionary. When will you let me solve Letter Box for it?
